# 🎬 ICD for Movies — Turning Document Collections Into Videos

AI‑assisted movie creation follows the same **ICD (Instruct → Chat/Design → Deploy)** pattern as AI website builders and presentation builders.  
The difference is that movie‑creation tools behave more like **presentation creators with a timeline**, where the emphasis is on:

- **Designing the narrative flow**
- **Choosing visuals, avatars, or scenes**
- **Letting the AI assemble the video**
- **Using chat mainly during the planning phase**

These tools take your **document collection**—your structured knowledge base—and turn it into short, polished videos that communicate your ideas visually.

# 📚 Document Collections as the Foundation for Video Creation

Before generating a movie, you prepare a **document collection** containing:

- Markdown files, summaries, and notes  
- GitHub repositories  
- Webpages or generated sites  
- PDFs, diagrams, or cheat sheets  
- Conceptual frameworks or scripts  

This collection becomes the **source material** from which the AI extracts:

- Key messages  
- Narration  
- Visual themes  
- Slide‑like sequences  
- Avatar scripts or voiceovers  

The AI then transforms this into a **video narrative**.

# 🧩 ICD Workflow for Movie Creation

Movie‑creation tools follow the same pattern as ICD systems, but with a stronger emphasis on **DESIGN** and less on continuous chat.

---

## 📝 INSTRUCT  
You begin by giving the system:

- A description of the video you want  
- Links to your document collection  
- The tone, style, and length (usually 1–2 minutes)  
- Whether you want avatars, slides, or abstract visuals  

This instruction seeds the entire video.

---

## 🎨 DESIGN (More Important Than Chat)  
Video builders focus heavily on:

- Storyboarding  
- Scene sequencing  
- Avatar selection  
- Visual style  
- Timing and pacing  

The AI extracts structure from your document collection and proposes:

- A script  
- A sequence of scenes  
- Visual elements  
- Transitions and timing  

This is the **core phase** of movie creation.

---

## 💬 CHAT (Used Mainly for Refinement)  
Chat is available, but less central than in website builders.

You use it to:

- Adjust the script  
- Change the avatar  
- Add or remove scenes  
- Modify pacing  
- Insert new content  

Most of the work happens in the design interface.

---

## 🚀 DEPLOY  
Once the video is ready, you can:

- Export it  
- Share it  
- Embed it  
- Use it in presentations or websites  

These tools produce polished, short videos ideal for introductions, summaries, or concept explanations.

---
