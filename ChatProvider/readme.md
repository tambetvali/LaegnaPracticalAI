# 🌐 Webpages as Document Collections

A **webpage** is one of the simplest and most universal formats for a document collection.  
Whether you hand‑craft a site, export from Notion, generate from Markdown, or let an AI build it for you, the result is the same: a **public, link‑based knowledge base** that any AI system can read, analyze, and use to specialize itself on your material.  
Generated webpages work just as well—AI tools can ingest them, extract structure, and treat them as a coherent documentation system.
