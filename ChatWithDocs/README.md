# 💬 Chat With Your Document Collections

Modern AI tools make it possible to **talk directly with your own documents**.  
Once you create a structured **document collection**—a set of Markdown files, PDFs, websites, or repositories—you can load it into various AI systems. These systems can then read your materials, answer questions about them, summarize them, and help you refine or expand your knowledge base.

This folder introduces two complementary ways to chat with your documents:

- **Integral** — chatting *inside* the tools where your documents already live  
- **Entegral** — chatting *externally* using stand‑alone AI programs that ingest your collections  

Both approaches turn your documentation into a living, interactive knowledge environment.

## 📁 1. *Integral Chat Systems*  
**File:** [`integral.md`](integral.md)

Many document‑collection environments already include **built‑in AI chat**.  
These systems allow you to talk with your documents *directly inside the editor or platform* where they are stored. Examples include VSCode, Obsidian, GitHub, and Notion.

The `integral.md` document explains:

- How these platforms integrate AI chat  
- How they automatically read your project files  
- How to use them to explore, summarize, and improve your documentation  

If your document collection already lives in one of these environments, integral chat gives you the most seamless experience.

## 🖥️ 2. *Entegral Chat Systems*  
**File:** [`entegral.md`](entegral.md)

Many stand‑alone AI programs can ingest **external document collections**—your local folders, cloned GitHub repositories, or exported archives.  
These tools run on your computer and allow you to chat with your documents privately and offline.

The `entegral.md` document introduces three such systems:

- **GPT4All** — a fully local, private chatbot with document indexing  
- **Jan** — a simple, fast AI chat tool evolving toward full collection support  
- **LM Studio** — a local AI server with document indexers and custom bot architecture  

These tools are ideal if you want privacy, offline access, or a customizable local AI environment.

## ✨ Summary

This folder helps you understand two complementary ways to chat with your documents:

- **Integral** → Chat *inside* your documentation tools  
- **Entegral** → Chat *externally* using local AI programs  

Together, they give you a complete toolkit for turning your document collections into interactive, intelligent companions.
