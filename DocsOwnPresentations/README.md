# 🎞️ AI‑Assisted Presentation Creation From Document Collections

AI‑driven presentation builders follow the same core idea as ICD (Instruct–Chat–Deploy) website builders:  
you prepare a **document collection**, give it to an AI system, and the AI transforms your knowledge into a structured, visual presentation.

The difference is that presentation builders focus less on continuous chat and more on **planning, structuring, and designing** slides based on your materials.

## 📚 Document Collections as the Foundation

Before creating a presentation, you prepare a **document collection** containing:

- Markdown files, PDFs, notes  
- GitHub repositories  
- Summaries, diagrams, cheat sheets  
- Webpages or generated sites  
- Research materials or conceptual frameworks  

This collection becomes the **knowledge base** from which the AI extracts:

- Key ideas  
- Slide structure  
- Visual hierarchy  
- Explanations and summaries  
- Diagrams or conceptual groupings  

Once your collection is ready, you can feed it into an ICD‑style presentation builder.

# 🧩 ICD for Presentations: Instruct → Design → Deploy

Presentation builders follow a similar workflow to web‑app ICD systems, but with a stronger emphasis on **DESIGN** and less on chat.

---

## 📝 INSTRUCT  
You begin by giving the system:

- A natural‑language instruction  
- Links to your document collection  
- A description of the presentation’s purpose  
- Any constraints (length, tone, audience, style)  

This instruction seeds the entire presentation.

---

## 🎨 DESIGN (More Important Than Chat)  
Unlike web‑app builders, presentation systems:

- Ask more clarifying questions  
- Spend more time planning structure  
- Focus on slide hierarchy and flow  
- Automatically extract key points from your materials  

This is where the AI decides:

- How many slides  
- What goes on each slide  
- What visuals or diagrams to include  
- How to group your ideas  

Chat exists, but the **design phase is the core**.

---

## 💬 CHAT (Less Emphasis Than Websites)  
You can still refine the presentation through chat:

- “Add a slide about X”  
- “Rewrite this section more simply”  
- “Combine these two slides”  
- “Add visuals or icons”  

But the chat is usually shorter and more focused.

---

## 🚀 DEPLOY  
Once the presentation is ready, you can:

- Export it  
- Share it  
- Present it online  
- Embed it  
- Continue editing manually  

Some systems also allow exporting to PDF or PowerPoint.
